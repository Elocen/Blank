# gmrm

Welcome to the home of our `gmrm` software. The code is hybrid-parallel software for a Bayesian grouped mixture of regressions model for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). It is written in C++ using extensive optimisations and code vectorisation. It relies on plink's .bed format. It can analyse multiple traits simultaneously.

For an overview, help with compilation, and a documented workflow example please see our wiki:

The software was developed by Etienne Orliac and Matthew R. Robinson. Funding was provided by a Swiss National Science Foundation Eccellenza Grant to MRR (PCEGP3-181181), and by core funding from the Institute of Science and Technology Austria.
